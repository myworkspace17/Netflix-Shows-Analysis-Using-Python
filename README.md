# Netflix Shows Analysis Using Python
Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Netflix's movies and TV shows. The primary objective was to clean the data and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights. The analysis identifies patterns in the data, such as genre distributions, average ratings, and content release trends, while ensuring the dataset is properly cleaned and ready for analysis.
Key Tasks:
•	Data Cleaning:
o	Removed or handled missing values.
o	Standardized column formats and types.
o	Created a clean DataFrame that was ready for in-depth data analysis.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o	Analyzed key attributes like genre distribution, ratings, and the differentiation between movies and TV shows.
o	Investigated trends such as content releases over time and changes in Netflix's catalog.
•	Data Visualization:
o	Created various visualizations to present insights, including genre distributions and ratings comparisons.
o	Used charts and graphs to effectively communicate patterns in the dataset.
Key Insights:
•	Genre Distribution: Identified the most and least popular genres within the Netflix library.
•	Content Release Trends: Analyzed trends in the release of movies and TV shows over the years.
•	Ratings Analysis: Compared average ratings across different genres and between movies and TV shows.
Technologies Used:
•	Python: Main language for performing data analysis and visualization.
•	Pandas: Used for data cleaning, manipulation, and creating the clean DataFrame.
•	Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries used to visualize the data and generate charts.
•	NumPy: Used for numerical operations during analysis.
Dataset:
•	The dataset includes details about Netflix's movies and TV shows, such as titles, genres, ratings, and release years.
